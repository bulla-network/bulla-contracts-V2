## Deploying

Bash arguments - these can either go in a .env or placed in the cli:

1. `LOCK_STATE` - the contract is deployable in a lock state: (0 = unlocked, 1 = no new claims, 2 = completely locked to EOA transactions)
2. `RPC_URL` - the contract is deployable in a lock state: (0 = unlocked, 1 = no new claims, 2 = completely locked to EOA transactions)
3. `PRIVATE_KEY` - the private key of the deployer address (see forge's --ledger or --trezor wallet options for hardware wallet deployment details)

Notice: The deployer address will be the owner of the contract.

Example:

```bash
anvil
source .env.development # for a local anvil server # $ source .env for prod
LOCK_STATE=$LOCK_STATE forge script script/Deployment.s.sol:Deployment --fork-url $RPC_URL --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY --broadcast -vvvvv
```
